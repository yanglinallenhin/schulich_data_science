    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "1. **Lower Bound on Cost:**  \n",
    "   - The LP relaxation gives an **optimal cost of \\$1,660.51**, which is **lower** than the integer solution **(\\$1,750 from part (e))**.\n",
    "   - This confirms that **enforcing integer constraints increases cost** because it restricts flexibility in assigning attendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fractional Assignments:**  \n",
    "   - Since binary constraints are relaxed, **some rooms may be fractionally assigned to multiple attendants**.\n",
    "   - For example, **one room might be assigned 0.3 to one attendant and 0.7 to another**, which is **not feasible in reality**.\n",
    "   - The integer solution (IP) will have to round these values, which typically increases cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difference in Overtime & Violations:**  \n",
    "   - **Total overtime (4.0 hours) remains the same** as in the integer solution.\n",
    "   - **Total floor violations remain at 0**, meaning no attendant exceeded the floor limit in either solution.\n",
    "   - This suggests that overtime was necessary in both cases, but the cost was **lower** in the relaxed solution due to fractional flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solution Efficiency:**  \n",
    "   - The LP relaxation **converged quickly** (in **84 iterations** and **0.03 seconds**).\n",
    "   - This is **much faster** than the integer solution, which required **12,893 branch-and-bound nodes**.\n",

    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "1. **Higher Overtime Cost Leads to Fewer Overtime Hours**\n",
    "   - The **total overtime hours dropped from 4.0 to 2.0**, which means the optimization **preferred reducing overtime usage** when it became **twice as expensive**.\n",
    "   - Instead of using extra hours, the model **reallocated workload differently**, leading to an increase in floor violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increase in Total Cost**\n",
    "   - The total staffing cost **increased from $1,750.00 to $1,775.00**.\n",
    "   - This is expected because **reducing overtime means more attendants must clean additional floors**, triggering **floor bonuses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **New Floor Violation**\n",
    "   - In the original model **no attendants exceeded two floors**.\n",
    "   - Now, **one attendant exceeded the two-floor limit**, leading to an additional **floor bonus** of **$75 per extra floor**.\n",
    "   - This suggests that **the model prioritized violating the floor constraint rather than incurring expensive overtime**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Was Our Intuition in Part (d) Correct?**\n",
    "**Yes, our intuition in part (d) was correct.** In part (d), we hypothesized that:\n",
    "- **2× overtime wage is significantly more expensive** than keeping extra floors.\n",
    "- The model would **prefer assigning additional floors** rather than paying **higher overtime costs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Confirmed:** The solution **reduces overtime and increases floor violations**, which aligns with our expectations from part (d).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Conclusion**\n",
    "- Increasing the **overtime wage multiplier from 1.5× to 2×** resulted in:\n",
    "  - **Higher total cost (+$25.00)**\n",
    "  - **Less overtime usage (-2 hours)**\n",
    "  - **More floor violations (+1 attendant exceeding 2 floors)**\n",
    "- **This confirms that minimizing overtime cost is a priority**, even if it means breaking floor constraints.\n",
